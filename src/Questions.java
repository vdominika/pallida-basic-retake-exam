//What is inheritance? When would you use it? [2p]
//
//        Inheritance can be defined as the process where one class acquires the properties (methods and fields) of another. The class which inherits the properties of other is known as subclass (derived class, child class) and the class whose properties are inherited is known as superclass (base class, parent class).
//
//        With the use of inheritance the information is easily manageable in a hierarchical system.
